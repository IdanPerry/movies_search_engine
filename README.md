# Movies Search Engine
Finally started my first Django project! (and actually my first python project). :blush:

This search engine assembles movies and tv-shows from various websites, and merge them with the corresponding dada from IMDb.com,
providing more search options (by IMDb rating for example), as well as allowing higher probability finding the desired movie (or tv-show) all in one place.

#### Tech:
* Backend: Django and PostgeSQL.
* Fronend: raw HTML & CSS.

#### Dependncies:
* django
* psycopg2
* psycopg2-binary
* requests
* bs4
* selenium
* aiohttp

#### Demo of what was accomplished so far:
